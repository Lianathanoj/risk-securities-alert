#Securities Risk Alert

##Inspiration
Today’s rapidly changing financial landscape combined with the need for travel and decentralized businesses calls for a way to have accurate, real-time data of one’s financial assets while on the go. By automating both notifications and data analysis in mobile devices through BlackRock’s extensive Aladdin API, we enable people to view their portfolio, analyze their securities, and make important, time-sensitive decisions whenever necessary.

##Product

To do this, it takes advantage of BlackRock’s Aladdin API to keep track of a scalable portfolio’s real-time data, performs analysis on that data, and juxtaposes a chosen risk threshold level with with the calculated risk. This application implements effective security protocol against web exploitations all while allowing free user access.
